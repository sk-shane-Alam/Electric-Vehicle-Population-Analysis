# 🚗⚡ **Electric Vehicle Population Analysis**

Electric Vehicles (EVs) are becoming the core of modern sustainable transportation.
This project analyzes EV population data to reveal trends in adoption, model performance, electric range, CAFV eligibility, and regional distribution.
Using **SQL, Python, and Power BI**, the project converts raw EV data into clear insights and interactive dashboards that support informed decision-making.

## ❗ **Problem Statement**

Stakeholders often lack clarity on which EV models perform best, how electric range varies, and which regions show strong or weak EV adoption.
This makes it difficult for businesses, governments, and sustainability teams to plan infrastructure, create policies, or understand market behavior.
This project simplifies the data and highlights meaningful patterns to solve that gap.

## 🔍 **Key Insights**

### 🚙 **1. Market Leaders**

* Models like **Nissan Leaf**, **Tesla Model 3**, and **Tesla Model S** dominate registrations.
* These brands show strong user trust and consistent performance.

### 🔋 **2. BEVs vs PHEVs**

* **BEVs deliver significantly higher electric range** than PHEVs.
* BEVs are more aligned with clean-energy policies and consumer demand.

### 🧾 **3. CAFV Eligibility**

* Majority of EVs qualify for **CAFV incentives**, linked to better range and performance.
* Vehicles with low electric range show lower eligibility.

### 🗺️ **4. Regional EV Adoption**

* Urban and developed regions show higher EV adoption due to better charging infrastructure.
* Rural zones have comparatively slower adoption.

### 📈 **5. Growth Trend**

* Strong rise in EV registrations between **2016–2020** followed by slight fluctuations afterward.
