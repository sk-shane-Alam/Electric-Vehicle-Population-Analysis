# 🚗⚡ **Electric Vehicle Population Analysis**

Electric Vehicles (EVs) are becoming the core of modern sustainable transportation.
This project analyzes EV population data to uncover trends in adoption, model performance, electric range, CAFV eligibility, and regional distribution.
Using **SQL, Python, and Power BI**, the project transforms raw EV data into clear insights and interactive dashboards for informed decision-making.

---

## ❗ **Problem Statement**

Stakeholders often lack clarity on which EV models perform best, how electric range varies, and which regions adopt EVs more rapidly.
This gap makes it difficult for businesses, policymakers, and sustainability teams to plan infrastructure, shape policies, and understand market behavior.
This project organizes and simplifies the data to highlight meaningful patterns and support smarter EV-related decisions.
